# Overview

This C++ project implements a classic checkers game that runs in the console. The game features a standard 8x8 board where two players can compete against each other by moving pieces diagonally and capturing opponent pieces by jumping over them.

The software includes an 8x8 game board representation using ascii keys with visual display of the location of each piece in the console.
Player turn management (X and O pieces), and move validation for regular and capture moves are tracked and stored in the arrays for each location. User input is handled with chess-like notation (e.g., "B2 C3"), of where it is and where the player wants to play.

The primary purposes of this project was to learn some fundementals of C++ programming with 2D array manipulation, practice implementing game logic and management, and receive and use user input and  interaction with the system.

# Development Environment

Some tools used were Visual Studio Code, Xcode, or another IDE that runs C++. A G++ or MinGW Compiler was used for...compiling. 
Git was used as our code HQ for version control.

The project is written in C++ and utilizes standard input/output streams (iostream), 2D arrays for board representation, control structures (loops, conditionals), functions for modularity, and basic object-oriented programming concepts.
